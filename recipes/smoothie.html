      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>Whole wheat bread is delicious and nutritious, not to mention much
      cheaper than store bought options when made at home! Enjoy this bread
      with peanut butter for breakfast, or use in sandwiches to elevate the
      rest of your ingredients.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
	 <li>Whole Wheat Flour</li>
	 <li>Water</li>
	 <li>Yeast</li>
	 <li>Salt</li>
	 <li>Oil</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <ol>
	 <li>Proof your yeast by mixing into 3tbsp of water and dissolving.
	    Once the yeast starts to bubble and foam, it is activated and
	    ready to be used.</li>
	 <li>Mix flour, water, yeast mixture, and salt together in a large
	    bowl until all the ingredients combine into a sticky
	    dough.</li>
	 <li>Beat and/or knead the dough until it is very well mixed. Cover
	 with wrap or lid and allow to rest for 30 minutes.</li>
	 <li>After resting, knead the dough firmly on a counter or in a
	    mixer with dough hook attachment. If the dough is still sticky,
	 sprinkle extra flour to allow it to pull away from the counter or
	 bowl. Stop kneading when the dough is very stretchy and not too
	 sticky on the outside.</li>
	 <li>Coat a large mixing bowl in oil and place the dough inside to
	    proof. Let rise for 2-3 hours.</li>
	 <li>After proofing, lightly punch down your dough to remove the
	    large air bubbles. Place into an oiled loaf pan, cover with
	    wrap, and allow to rise once more for 1-2 hours, or until the
	    dough has crested about one inch above the rim of the pan.</li>
	 <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Place your bread
	 inside and bake for 40-45 minutes.</li>
	 <li>Remove the loaf from the oven once the crust is golden brown
	    and feels hollow when tapped on. Rest inside the loaf pan for 5
	    minutes before removing to cool completely.</li>
      </ol>
